        <h1>Statement</h1>
        <p>I consider exploration is one of the most important aspects of life in general. When many people think of exploration, they often think of Indiana Jones, or going on massive quests in the jungle, however, I am refering to exploration in general. Exploration is a lot of different things, scuh as exploring your local park with a quick walk, exploring the universe with a telescope, or exploring the vast world of knowledge by learning something new in a book. Going out and exploring, and trying new things is how you can grow as a person, and is something which just about everyone has done before, however I beleive it is something we should do more often.</p>
