        <p>Hey there, my name is Alexander Dixon-Nissen. In this website, I've collected just a handful of the several things which I value, including mental and physical fitness, the ability to explore, and the place in which I'm born, the Pacific Northwest. My goal is to show you why I appreciate them, showcase my experiences and accomplishments with them, and to maybe even get you, the viewer, to appreciate them yourself. To learn about some of these values and get a glipse into my life, you can hover over my name on the top header of this page.</p>
