        <p>I have been born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, and I'm happy to call it my home. I truly love the Pacific Northwest, with its mountains, forests, beaches, lakes, and even the rain and snow. I've had a lot of experience with the PNW having lived here my whole life, and I've seen a lot of cool things here.</p>
