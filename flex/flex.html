                <p>Flexboxes give the ability for the browser to adjust sizing and orientation based on the screen.  So if you tell it to do so, it can change the size of elements or how many go on a row as the size of the screen changes</p>
                <p>Want to see an example? Go to Google Classroom. It uses Flexboxes to show the classes as boxes on the home page after you've logged in. </p>
